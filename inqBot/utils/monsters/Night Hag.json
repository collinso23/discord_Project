        "Claws (Hag Form Only).": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing\ndamage.",
        "Etherealness.": "The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a\nheartstone in her possession.",
        "Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).": "While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A\nprotection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has\ndreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5\n(1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul\nbag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic."
