Each\ncreature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison\ndamage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a\nsuccess. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.",
