If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the\ncreature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must\nrepeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.
