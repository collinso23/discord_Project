Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the\ntarget must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another\ncreature can use an action to shake the target awake.",
        "Change Shape.": "The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or\nback into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the\ncouatl's choice).  \n\n\nIn a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are\nreplaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the\nnew form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.",
        "Constrict.": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3)\nbludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the couatl can't constrict\nanother target."
